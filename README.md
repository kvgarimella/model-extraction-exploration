# Model Extraction Exploration 

This repository contains partial implementations for model extraction attacks found in:
1. [High Accuracy and High Fidelity Extraction of Neural Networks (Matthew Jagielski, Nicholas Carlini, David Berthelot, Alex Kurakin, Nicolas Papernot @ USENIX 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01838)
2. [Cryptanalytic Extraction of Neural Network Models (Nicholas Carlini, Matthew Jagielski, Ilya Mironov @ CRYPTO 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04884)

You will find two tutorial Jupyter Notebooks within the `tutorials` directory. Most of the implementation is in [Jax](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). I would recommend launching the notebooks in a Google Colab environment. However, if you wish to run these locally, you may run

```bash 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
